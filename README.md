# Java-Sudoku_Solver-Recursive_Backtracking

This is a Sudoku solver which uses the concept of recursive backtraking. Please take a look!

You can directly bring the program into your IDE as a existed project. The program is thoroughly tested and bugs free.
You can use the sample sudoku (puzzle1) or you can choose to create your own puzzle.

There are two puzzle1.txt (one in bin and one in src) since sometimes the file in bin doesn't get downloaded. 
It is fine to have two puzzle1.txt files in the project folder.

Please input absolute file path when the program asks for a file name.

Have Fun!
